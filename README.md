# PairItHub
Creating a community to share, invest, and request ideas for start up projects

PairItHub is a prototype platform that allows hackers to connect and collaborate to bring app ideas to life. Our intuitive platform supports the open source community and provides a space for builders to showcase their ideas to a league of supporters, matching projects with like-minded individuals. We developed this platform with the goal of potentially serving as a platform for spontaneous "hackathons", facilitating the creative process of bringing apps to completion.
